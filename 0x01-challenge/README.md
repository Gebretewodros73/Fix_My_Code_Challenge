This directory contains multiple coding challenges that require debugging and fixing. Each challenge is located in a specific directory within the `0x01-challenge` directory of the repository. Below is a brief description of each challenge and its corresponding location within the repository.

## Task 0: Server status

* Directory: [0x01-challenge/status_server](./0x01-challenge/status_server)
* File: [api/v1/app.py](./api/v1/app.py)

The task involves fixing a Flask project's route for the status of the API. The route is expected to be accessible at `http://0.0.0.0:5000/api/v1/status`, but it currently returns a "Not found" error. Your help is required to fix this issue.

## Task 1: My square

* Directory: [0x01-challenge](./0x01-challenge)
* File: [square.py](./square.py)

In this task, there is a `square.py` file that contains code related to a square geometry implementation. The code needs improvement to make the square perfect. Your task is to review the code and make necessary changes to achieve the desired result.

## Task 2: Step 2: User model

* Directory: [0x01-challenge](./0x01-challenge)
* File: [user.py](./user.py)

This task involves fixing an OOP project related to a user model. The code is not functioning properly, and your task is to identify and fix the issues to make it work as intended.

## Task 3: Blog access

* Directory: [0x01-challenge](./0x01-challenge)
* File: [blog](./blog)

In this task, a Rails blog project has been deployed, but users are unable to access any of the blog posts. The code base is provided, and you are required to investigate and fix the issue. Additionally, a new feature needs to be implemented, which involves adding a boolean attribute named `online` to each `Post` object. The default value of this attribute should be `true`. You also need to provide a way to change this boolean value in the `Post#edit` route.
